# The Music of John Low

The music for a part of the movie The Music of John Low, scored for a small 
symphony orchestra.

The theme(s) is a melody that John Low heared and played as a child. It is for
him strongly associated the trauma around his mother's death.

In his head the music finally takes a strong shape when he defeats the lurker,
and the music grows from a solo violin with discrete accompainment to what 
sounds more like the first part of a symphony.

The music should somehow reflect late 19th century american orchestral music, 
since that's the period of John's boyhood.
