# The Music of John Low

The music for a part of the movie The Music of John Low, scored for a small 
symphony orchestra.

The theme is a melody that John Low heared and played as a child. It is, for
him, strongly associated with the trauma around his mother's death.

John has not been able to play the violin after that, and the melody haunts 
him now and then through his adult life.

In his head the music finally takes a strong shape when he defeats the lurker,
and the music grows from a solo violin with discrete accompainment to what 
sounds more like the first part of a symphony.

The music should somehow reflect late 19th century american orchestral music, 
since that's the period of John's boyhood.
