# The Music of John Low

The music for a part of the movie The Music of John Low, scored for a small 
symphony orchestra.

The theme is a melody that John Low heared and played as a child. It is, for
him, strongly associated with the trauma around his mother's death.

John has not been able to play the violin since then and the melody haunts 
him through his adult life, until his confrontation with the lurker in the dark.

In his head the music finally takes a firmer shape when he defeats the lurker,
and the music grows from a solo violin with discrete accompainment to what 
sounds more like the first part of a symphony.

The orchestral music should somehow reflect that of the late 19th century 
America, since that is the period and place of John's childhood.
